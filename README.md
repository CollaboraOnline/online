## Integrating

To [integrate](https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/why_integrate.html) Collabora Online into your own solution, you can see our [step-by-step tutorial](https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/Step_by_step_tutorial.html), view the [available integrations](https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/available_integrations.html), understand the [post message API](https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/postmessage_api.html) used to customize and interact with Collabora Online, and a lot more.


### Test running with integration for developers

Set up Nextcloud or ownCloud on localhost and install the richdocuments app, or explore other integrations that can be used to test Collabora Online at https://www.collaboraonline.com/integrations/.

Good tutorials exist how to install ownCloud or Nextcloud, we don't repeat
them here. richdocuments is called Collabora Online in the respective app
stores / marketplaces / whatever.

When you have a running Nextcloud or ownCloud instance at
http://localhost/nextcloud or at http://localhost/owncloud
go to Collabora Online settings, and set the WOPI URL to
http://localhost:9980

Then in the build tree, edit the generated coolwsd.xml and set ssl setting to
false. You can run make run, and test coolwsd with the ownCloud or Nextcloud
integration.

Note: if SSL is enabled in either Online or the integration, both must
have SSL enabled. That is, you must access NC/OC using https:// as well
as configure the Collabora Online endpoint in NC/OC as https://localhost:9980.

  * The client which lives in its own chroot and renders documents
* **common/**
  * Shared code between these processes
* **browser/**
  * The client side JavaScript component

## iOS and Android apps

### Building

See the corresponding web pages:
* **[Build for iOS](https://collaboraonline.github.io/post/build-code-ios/)**
* **[Build for Android](https://collaboraonline.github.io/post/build-code-android/)**

### Releases and pre-releases

Releases and pre-release builds are made from the
`distro/collabora/co-25.04-mobile` branch. Releases for Android and iOS are
generally built from the same commit, and are tagged as a release on GitHub.

Android snapshots are automatically built once a week, but may be built more
frequently if there's something new to test. iOS testflight builds are
exclusively built when there is something new to test. Pre-release builds are
not tagged in GitHub.

### Getting changes into 25.04-mobile

You should still develop against `master`, even if you're working on
mobile-only features. Changes made in `master` will be moved into the
`distro/collabora/co-25.04` branch according to the release schedule. Changes
from the `distro/collabora/co-25.04` branch are then regularly cherry-picked
into the `distro/collabora/co-25.04-mobile` branch.

If you have a change which you want to get into mobile snapshots or releases
more quickly, you should still develop it against `master`. When it's merged
into `master`, you should make a backport pull request against
`distro/collabora/co-25.04-mobile`. Please don't make pull requests directly
against `distro/collabora/co-25.04-mobile` (i.e. without the change first being
merged into `master`).

## GitPod

Head over to https://collaboraonline.github.io/post/build-code/#build-code-on-gitpod and follow the steps.

## Admin Panel

You can access the admin panel by directly accessing the admin.html file
from browser directory.

Websocket connections to admin console can be made at path: /adminws/ on the
same url and port as coolwsd is running on. However, one needs a JWT token to
authenticate to the admin console websocket. This is stored as a cookie with
`Path: /adminws/` when user successfully authenticates when trying to access
/browser/dist/admin/admin\*html files (HTTP Basic authentication). Token
is expired after every half an hour, so websocket connection to admin console
must be established within this period.

It should also be possible to do various sorts of tasks such as killing
documents that are open for more than 10 hours etc. See protocol.txt for
various commands. Only tricky thing here is getting the JWT token which can
be obtained as described above.

## Protocol description

See **[protocol.txt](wsd/protocol.txt)** for a description of the protocol to be used over the
websocket.

Please refer to https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/architecture.html

## Enjoy!
