Leaflet platform for LibreOffice Online
========================================

This is the client part of LibreOffice Online.  For the server part, see the
../wsd/README, and install it first.

Build dependencies
------------------

npm is provided by the nodejs package.

npm should be at least 2.14, if not 3.x. Use `npm -v` to find the current version.
Upgrade npm (as root):

    npm install -g npm

Another way is to use npm as a user, but set its prefix to a directory where
you have write access. If you want that, you need to have an ~/.npmrc with the
line e.g.

    prefix=/opt/npm

All of the dependency tree is locked in the repository, so there is no need to fetch
data from npm registry at all. An npm install will use the tarballs in node_shrinkwrap/
directory, so build process can move forward even without an internet connection.

To update any of the dependency, process often goes like this:

1.) Change version of the dependency in package.json
2.) Do an `npm update <package_name>', which fetches the new module from npm registry. Make sure that
    only the module that you want to update is updated.
3.) `npm shrinkwrap --dev` to update npm-shrinkwrap.json with newer information. You might see
    that this tool updates path convention of tarballs inside node_shrinkwrap/ also, but this
    should get corrected in next step.
4.) Do `shrinkpack', which should remove the old tarball, add new one, and make appropriate
    changes to npm-shrinkwrap.json (removing path convention changes by step 3).

If you have not installed `shrinkpack' globally using `npm install -g shrinkpack@next', it should be
in node_modules/.bin/shrinkpack, so you can use the binary from there.

If you need to get the sources:
	make libs

To bundle the file sanitize-url.js
	browserify braintree-sanitize-url/index.js --standalone sanitizeUrl > sanitize-url.js

Building
--------

Just do:

    make

Above step would create a non-minified bundle.js and admin-bundle.js without source-maps in dist/ for main loleaflet and admin console
respectively.

To build with debug-info, i.e with sourcemaps:

    make DEBUG=true

Above will produce source-map files, bundle.js.map and admin-bundle.js.map, for bundle.js and admin-bundle.js respectively.
It will also link existing bundle.js and admin-bundle.js to their map files by adding a sourceMappingURL to them. While debugging,
these .map files will be fetched from the server if present in dist/, otherwise there is no way to debug while browsing without these
source-map files.

To minify our bundle.js and admin-bundle.js passing a MINIFY=true flag to 'make' will minify it. This can be helpful in production
environments.

    make MINIFY=true

'make dist' forces minifying.

Running
-------

To see an example:

* run loolwsd, like:

    ./loolwsd --o:sys_template_path=${SYSTEMPLATE} --o:child_root_path=${ROOTFORJAILS}

Note that this will, by default, set the loolwsd's file server's root to the parent directory of loolwsd,
which means you can access all the files in loleaflet using /loleaflet/ path. It is advised to set
file_server_root_path manually for more control. See wsd/README for more information.

* open dist/loleaflet.html through loolwsd's fileserver

    https://localhost:9980/loleaflet/dist/loleaflet.html?file_path=file:///PATH/TO_DOC&host=wss://localhost:9980

and you should see the document in the browser.
Note that accessing local storage is disabled by default for security reasons. You need to explicitly enable it
with the --o:storage.filesystem[@allow]=true option of loolwsd. In case anything goes wrong, check the loolwsd console for
the debugging output. You might be asked to confirm the certificate if you are using self-signed certificate
for loolwsd.

Development
-----------

For faster development you might want to install browser-sync which can reload app in your browsers automatically
after you edit and save the source code (so for .css only):

npm install -g browser-sync

Remember to add '--enable-browsersync' argument for './configure' script and delete `dist` directory.

Run server and start browser-sync:

LOOL_SERVE_FROM_FS=1 make run

and in the second terminal:

make sync-[writer|calc|impress]

Your browser will open example document and now you can edit .css files and see the result without server restart.

To run another document use:
browser-sync start --config browsersync-config.js --startPath "loleaflet/96c23f663/loleaflet.html?file_path=file:///path/to/the/file.ods"

Admin Panel
-----------

You can do live monitoring of all the user sessions running on loolwsd instance. To access the admin
console you need to ask for admin.html file from loolwsd which resides in dist/admin/admin.html.

For example:

    https://localhost:9980/loleaflet/dist/admin/admin.html

It will ask for username and password which is set by the admin_console options of loolwsd. For example you can
pass --o:admin_console.username=admin --o:admin_console.password=admin in command line, or set these values in
loolwsd.xml. After entering the correct password you should be able to monitor the live documents opened, total
users, memory consumption, document URLs with number of users viewing that document etc. You can also kill the
documents directly from the panel which would result in closing the socket connection to the respective document.

Code conventions:

    * files should have unix line terminators (LF)
    * tools to convert files: dos2unix or fromdos

Implementation details
----------------------

Loading a document:
    The map should have the following options:
        - server address
        - doc - path to the document that will be loaded
        - edit = the initial permission
        - readOnly - whether the document is read only
        - [timestamp] - optionally provided for remote documents

How zooming works:
    The zoom level goes from 1 to 20 (those limits can be changed) and the initial
    level is 10, which represents the 100% zoom level. The zoom factor is 1.2

Controls are added above the map in a div called "controls" is intended to be used as a toolbar.
There is no leaflet method of adding them in a separate div, so for now this is done in the html
document after the map initialization.

To enable scrollbars the map is placed above a div that contains a bigger div of
the document's size (a mock document). So the div under the map gets scrollbars which
are independent of the map's div, thus enabling us to link them to the map as needed.
When the user scrolls, the map is panned by the same amount as it would've been scrolled.
Also, some custom jquery scrollbars are used, to trigger the same scroll events across
browsers.
