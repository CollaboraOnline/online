About the app:
</p>

<p>
Collabora Office for Android uses the same engine as LibreOffice for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This, combined with a new front-end based on Collabora Online, reads and saves documents similarly to LibreOffice desktop.
</p>

<p>
Collabora Engineers Tor Lillqvist, Tomaž Vajngerl, Michael Meeks, Miklos Vajna and Jan Holešovský have been developing Android support since 2012, with the help of Google Summer of Code students Andrzej Hunt, Iain Billet and Kaishu Sahu.
