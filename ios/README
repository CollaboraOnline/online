How to build the iOS app:

1) First you need to build the LibreOffice core code for iOS. Put in
your autogen.input something like this:

--enable-debug
--enable-dbgutil
--enable-werror
--with-distro=LibreOfficeiOS

and build "normally". (Naturally, no unit tests will be run when
cross-compiling LibreOffice.) Of course there is no requirement to use
those --enable options; as a minimum, just
--with-distro=LibreOfficeiOS should work.

This will produce a large number of static archives (.a) here and
there in instdir and workdir, but no app that can be run as such. (You
can see a list of them in
workdir/CustomTarget/ios/ios-all-static-libs.list)

2) Do a separate clone of the online repo on macOS, but don't run any
make or open the Mobile project there yet.

3) Do a separate clone of the online repo on Linux, run autogen.sh,
and configure it with the --enable-iosapp option:

./configure --enable-iosapp

Then run make. That will produce files in loleaflet/dist, nothing
else. Copy those to the corresponding folder in the online clone
from step 2. This is what I do:

make clean && make && tar cf - loleaflet/dist | ssh misan.local 'cd lo/online-ios-device && tar xvf -'

where misan.local is the macOS machine where I build the app, in the
~lo/online-ios-device folder.

4) In the online folder form step 2, edit the
Mobile/Mobile.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj file in your favourite text
editor.

Change LOSRCDIR and all instances of "../ios-device" to refer the the
LibreOffice core source directory from step 1.

Then run:

./autogen.sh

and

./configure --enable-iosapp --with-iosapp-name="My Own Mobile LibreOffice" --with-lo-builddir=$HOME/lo/ios --with-poco-includes=/opt/ios-poco/include --with-poco-libs=/opt/ios-poco/lib

The configure script puts the app name as the CFBundleDisplayName
property into the Mobile/Mobile/Info.plist file, and set up some
symbolic links that point to the LIbreOffice core source and build
directories (which can be the same, of course).

4) Now you can open the Mobile Xcode project, build it, and run it.
