App Store "Test Details" text for the last TestFlight build
-----------------------------------------------------------

This version includes the latest 22.05.11 code and fixes the following bugs:

• The Paste button in the toolbar would sometimes be disabled even when there was content in the system pasteboard
• The Create Document dialog could not be dismissed by tapping outside the dialog or pressing a button
• A document's text direction could not be changed to right-to-left (RTL) or vertical because the Complex Text Layout (CTL) and Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) text layout features could not be enabled
