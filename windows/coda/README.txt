To build CODA for Windows:

First build LibreOffice core for Windows. Typically you would do that
the traditional way using Cygwin at the outermost level, but the
actual compiler is Visual Studio.

Then build or install Poco.

Then install xstd. The win64 prebuilt package should work fine. 

Then you configure online in WSL2, not in Cygwin, something like this:

./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-windowsapp --with-app-name=CODA --with-lo-builddir=/mnt/c/Users/tml/lo/core-coda-debug --with-poco-includes=/mnt/c/Users/tml/poco-1.13.3/include --with-poco-libs=/mnt/c/Users/tml/poco-1.13.3/lib64 --with-zstd-includes=/mnt/c/Users/tml/zstd-v1.5.6-win64/include --with-zstd-libs=/mnt/c/Users/tml/zstd-v1.5.6-win64/static

Note that this will run a bunch of checks for compiler features and
libraries (like cppunit, PAM, etc) on the WSL2 side that are
completely irrelevant. You will actually compile the code in Visual
Studio using the supplied project file and windows/coda/config.h.in.
But I haven't bothered adding lots of bypassing checks to
configure.ac. Using the Makefile (generated by all the autocrack) is
useful anyway as that is a convenient way to produce the bundled JS
thing.

Do *not* run a "make" in the top directory. Instead, to produce the
bundled JS, go to the "browser" subdirectory and run "make" there.
