/// RequestVettingStation is used to vet the request in the background.
/// Vetting for a WOPI request is performed through CheckFileInfo.
/// Once the request checks out, we can proceed to creating a
/// DocBroker and a Kit process.
/// There are two ways to use this class. One is to create it when
/// serving cool.html, the other when the WebSocket is created
/// (by upgrading the socket).
/// Unfortunately, when serving cool.html the connection is not the one
/// used for the WebSocket. As such, it cannot be used to create
/// DocBroker. Therefore, we work in two modes: we do the CheckFileInfo
/// as soon as we serve cool.html, but then we need to wait for the
/// WebSocket to create DocBroker.
/// A small complication is that CheckFileInfo might not be done by
/// then. Or, it might have timed out. Alternatively, the WebSocket
/// might never arrive (say, because the user clicked away).
/// We take these possibilities into account and support them here.
