Below is the description of the metrics returned by 'getMetrics' REST endpoint.
The general format of the output is complient with Prometheus text-based format
which can be found here: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-based-format

GLOBAL

    global_host_system_memory_bytes - Total host system memory in bytes.
    global_memory_available_bytes – Memory available to our application in bytes. This is equal to global_host_system_memory_bytes * memproportion where memproportion represents the maximum percentage of system memory consumed by all of the Collabora Online, after which we start cleaning up idle documents. This parameter can be setup in coolwsd.xml.
