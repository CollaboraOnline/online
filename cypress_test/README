Cypress based test framework for Collabora Online
===================================================


Installation
------------

You need to have run configure with the --enable-cypress option.

In a normal desktop environment you only need to install npm
packages for running cypress tests. This is done by the build
system, so running 'make check' will do the basic installation.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#npm-install

For CI you might need to install some additional dependencies:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html#Dependencies


Running tests
-------------

All tests are part of the make check build. So you can
just execute it from the root folder or under the
cypress_test folder to run cypress tests only.

    make check

IMPORTANT: Before stepping under cypress_test folder
and running any command listed here, make sure you've
done a top-level make, so everything is up-to-date.
Running commands from under cypress_test folder won't
trigger a rebuild.

To run cypress test cases selectively, you need to
go in to the cypress_test folder first and run one of
the following commands.

To run all desktop tests:

    make check-desktop

To run all mobile tests:

    make check-mobile

To run one specific test suite of desktop tests,
use spec argument with a relative path to
cypress_test/integration_tests/desktop/:

    make check-desktop spec=writer/form_field_spec.js

To run one specific test suite of mobile tests,
use spec argument with a relative path to
cypress_test/integration_tests/mobile/:

    make check-mobile spec=writer/toolbar_spec.js


Running one specific test
-------------------------

To run one test case of a test suite you can use Mocha's
'only' feature. Just replace the it(...) function with
it.only(...) in the spec file for the selected test case
and run the test suite using the spec parameter.

For example, to run the test with title 'Apply font name.'
inside apply_font_spec.js file, you need to add it.only():

-    it('Apply font name.', function() {
+    it.only('Apply font name.', function() {

Then run the test suite with:

    make check-mobile spec=writer/apply_font_spec.js

Or open the test suite in the interactive test runner:

    make run-mobile spec=writer/apply_font_spec.js

Openning interactive test runner
--------------------------------

Cypress has an interactive test runner application which
runs the test in the browser. So you can see the result of
the different steps your test makes in the browser. It's useful
during writing new tests or checking why an existing
test fails.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html

To open desktop tests in the test runner:

    make run-desktop

To open mobile tests in the test runner:

    make run-mobile

To open one specific test suite of desktop tests,
use spec argument with a relative path to
cypress_test/integration_tests/desktop/:

    make run-desktop spec=writer/form_field_spec.js

To open one specific test suite of mobile tests,
use spec argument with a relative path to
cypress_test/integration_tests/mobile/:

    make run-mobile spec=writer/toolbar_spec.js

During the build we run the tests with Chrome browser, so make sure
you select Chrome browser on the GUI while checking tests.
We are using different configuration and environment variables for
mobile and desktop tests, that's why there are two separate commands
for them and there is no option to open all the tests in the
test runner.

Running tests in different browsers
-----------------------------------

By default, the tests are run with chrome / chromium. If you need to
run the tests with a different browser, you can use the CYPRESS_BROWSER
variable:

CYPRESS_BROWSER="firefox" make check

This variable can be set to any value which is accepted by cypress
--browser command line argument:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt

Running tests with nextcloud integration
----------------------------------------

You can run any test runner command in an NC environment with setting
CYPRESS_INTEGRATION environment variable. For example:

CYPRESS_INTEGRATION="nextcloud" make check

Prerequisites:
* Need a local NC 20 installation connected with Collabora Online
* NC should be available at http://localhost/nextcloud/ (no ssl)
* Need an NC user with 'cypress_test' as user name and password.

Limitations:
* NC integration uses iframes which makes harder to test with cypress.
* cy.document() and cy.window() not properly works by now.

Running tests with php-proxy
----------------------------

You can run any test runner command with php-proxy with setting
CYPRESS_INTEGRATION environment variable. For example:

CYPRESS_INTEGRATION="php-proxy" make check

Prerequisites:
* Download php-proxy script:
https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/richdocumentscode/blob/master/proxy.php
* Put it under /srv/www/htdocs/richproxy/ folder.

Other useful flags
------------------

1. ENABLE_VIDEO_REC

You can enable video recording during running a test suite in headless mode.
So you can check visually what happens in the browser during the test.
Unfortunatelly this does not work for multi-user tests.

    ENABLE_VIDEO_REC="1" make check-mobile spec=writer/apply_font_spec.js

2. ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOG

With this flag we can enable logging for console.error() messages and so they
will be displayed in the command line. It's useful when we can reproduce a test
failure only in headless mode and we need to debug the client-side JS code.

    ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOG="1" make check-mobile spec=writer/apply_font_spec.js

Known issues
------------

1. Different builddir and sourcedir with symlinks.

Cypress has an issue with symlinks:
https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3482

We use the related feature only when the build directory
is different from the source directory. So to avoid this
issue with the supportFile, you should build in the source
directory or you should avoid symlinks in the path of the
build directory.

Code coverage
-------------

We use nyc to instrument the code and then cypress code coverage
plugin is used to generate coverage numbers. This workflow
is called by the following command:

    make run-cov

The output is put under cypress_test/covarage folder.
Open the cypress_test/covarage/lcov-report/index.html
file to get the summary report.

The make command above touches the source files under
loleaflet/dist/src folder, so after testing the coverage
doing a clean build is a good idea (e.g. make clean).

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/code-coverage.html

Used Packages
-------------

- cypress:
    Cypress integration test framework.

- cypress-failed-log:
    This package makes cypress to dump test logs to the command line
    when a test fails. You can write things to this log by calling
    cy.log() in the test code.

- cypress-log-to-output:
    This one can be used to dump console.error() messages to the command
    line. To enable this functionality you need to set ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOG
    environment variable. e.g. `ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOG="1" make check-mobile`.

- cypress-select-tests:
    We can filter out tests or test suites before execution using this
    package. Now, it is used to filter out tests based on the core's version.
    See plugins/blacklists.js.

- cypress-wait-until:
    Introduces cy.waitUntil() command which can be used as a while loop.
    We can't write loops in a cypress test otherwise. It's useful when
    the cypress tools can't be used to wait on something.

- eslint:
    A JS linter tool for identifying patterns in JavaScript code. We use this
    to make sure code conventions are met. Run by make check and make run-*.

- eslint-plugin-cypress-rules:
    This is our own eslint plugin to catch cypress specific patterns in the
    test code.

- get-port-cli:
    Used by the build system to find an available port to use as loolwsd's
    communication port.

- wait-on:
    Used by the build system to wait on loolwsd server to start before
    tests are started.
