Configuration
*************

Open "Server.py" and change the COOL and Solr server URL ("coolServerUrl" and "solrServerUrl") if they are different 
than localhost and default ports.

The "documentPath" constant is the root location of the documents (relative where Server.py was started). 

The "solrCollectionName" constant is the collection name where Solr should store the indices. 

The "coolInstance" is the URL to the COOL instance, which is used to open a document.

The collection needs to be created in Solr, if it doesn't yet exists with (from Solr root):
./bin/solr create -c <collection name>

For exmaple:
./bin/solr create -c documents
