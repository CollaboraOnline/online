/*
 * RulerSpacerSection - Reserves vertical space for the horizontal ruler
 * in the canvas section layout.
 *
 * This section acts as a layout spacer so that the TilesSection (and any
 * sections anchored to it, such as CompareChangesLabelSection) are
 * positioned below the ruler when it is visible.
 *
 * NOTE: The ruler itself is currently rendered as a Leaflet control
 * (see HRuler.ts / VRuler.ts) using legacy DOM placement via
 * map._controlCorners. In the future, ruler rendering should be moved
 * into this section, eliminating the Leaflet control dependency entirely.
