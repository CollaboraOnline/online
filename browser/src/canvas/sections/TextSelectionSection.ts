		There are questions like: Can a view have a selection in a part other than its currently selected part?
		New view layouts can allow multiple parts to be drawn at the same time.
		Unfortunately, we need to keep the selection's part and mode separate from the view.
		The behaviour between selections of a specific view:
			* Behaviour should be decided based on what the app is capable (remove one selection when other is initiated or keep them all etc).
			* Selections data (not the socket message, its data) should be handled in the DocumentViewBase class.
