    On Impress, when user presses mouse button and starts dragging, they start a selection.
    Which objects to select are determined by a rectangle. The objects inside the rectangle are selected.
    When user presses the mouse button and moves the mouse, they start to draw a selection rectangle.
    When they release the mouse button, rectangle is drawn.
    This class's purpose is to catch the selection rectangle's current properties:
        * Core side sends ".uno:Position" state change for mouse moves (whether there is a selection rectangle or not).
        * When user presses the mouse button and moves the mouse, core side sends the ".uno:Context=Mark objects" state change.
        * Core side sends ".uno:Size" as user moves the mouse (while holding the pressed mouse button).

    * Since mouse position is sent regardless of the selection, we will keep track of last mouse position.
        * No need to do anything special for this. State map variable should have it. Just fetch it as soon as we get "Mark objects" context.
    * We will listen to ".uno:Context=Mark objects" state change.
    * We will activate selection section when there is a selection.
    * Since this class has the data, selection section should be only drawing the rectangle.
