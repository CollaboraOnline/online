.TH COOLSTRESS "1" "Aug 2022" "coolstress" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
coolstress \- stress testing tool for Collabora Online.
.SH SYNOPSIS
coolstress [OPTIONS] SERVER PATH1 TRACE1 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Re-play trace files, either gzip compressed or verbatim against
a given server URL to simulate load against the server. A single
coolstress command can easily replay many concurrent traces.
.PP
If the same PATH is provided for multiple traces, then these are
both executed against the same document.
.SH COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
.PP
.SS "General options:"
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR                Show this usage information.
.SS "SERVER"
The server parameter points to a websocket end-point that would be
used by Collabora Online to drive a document editing session.
.PP
\fBExample:\fR coolstress wss://localhost:9980 /tmp/test.odt test/traces/hello-world.txt
.SS "Generating traces"
To generate a trace, set the following settings to these values in:
\fBcoolwsd.xml\fR: \fBtrace\fR true, \fBtrace.path\fR /tmp/trace.txt.gz
.PP
Re-start coolwsd, edit some documents and then load and
edit a document, after terminating coolwsd it should save a trace.
.PP
If passing extra parameters to coolwsd pass: --o:trace[@enable]=true --o:trace.path=/tmp/trace.txt.gz.
.PP
.SH "NOTE"
Please note that recording traces generated by mashing the keyboard rapidly creates a pathologically
unrealistic profile that is 10x faster than the average typer, and 5x worse then a professional typist
in terms of keys-per-second, as well as creating unusual documents from a spell/grammar checking
perspective.
