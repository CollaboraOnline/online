commit-msg
----------

This hooks supports the `commit.signOff` option.

This is a boolean value which lets you enable the -s/--signoff option of
commit by default.  Note: Adding the Signed-off-by: line to a commit should be
a conscious act and means that you certify you have the rights to submit this
work under the same open source license. Please see the README.CONTRIBUTING.md
document for further discussion. The option is ignored if the author and the
committer is not the same.
