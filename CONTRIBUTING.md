This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license. Please read [README.CONTRIBUTING.md](README.CONTRIBUTING.md). If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
